# What The Thenga üéØ

### Project Description
A useless mobile app that uses a machine learning model to determine if a photo contains a coconut tree. If it does, the app takes the current location and puts the data into a live weather API and pulls data of the local wind speed to predict the chances of a coconut falling on you. Now with looping mood music!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We aim to solve the problem of finding if a coconut will fall on your head

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The app helps you regulate the coconut falling-ness of a tree by checking the current wind speeds
